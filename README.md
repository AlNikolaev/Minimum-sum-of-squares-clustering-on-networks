# Minimum-sum-of-squares-clustering-on-networks

main.cpp is the source code of the algorithm which was proposed in Nikolaev, A., Mladenović, N., & Todosijević, R. (2017). J-means and I-means for minimum sum-of-squares clustering on networks. Optimization Letters, 11(2), 359-376.

# Execution

After creation of an executor please run the program with the following arguments:
1. The full path to the input file. The format  
2. Defined number of clusters
3. Strategy for finding initial solution ().
4. ...
5. ...

Working example for Windows:
MinSumOfSquares.exe path\pmed1.txt 5 v f m
